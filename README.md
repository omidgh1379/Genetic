# Genetic Ethnicity Inference Tool

This project uses **genetic data** (specifically SNPs from VCF files) and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to infer an individual's ethnicity based on their genotyping data. The tool is designed to allow users to upload their own genetic data in VCF format and visually explore where they fall in PCA space, which helps predict ethnicity.

This tool was developed using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Plotly**, and it leverages the **1000 Genomes Project** data for comparison. You can also explore the code and methodology behind the analysis.

## Overview

This project was developed as part of an effort to create a **genetic ethnicity inference system**. It allows users to upload their genetic data in **VCF format** and plots the data alongside known samples from the **1000 Genomes Project**. The system uses **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to visualize the data in a reduced dimensionality space (2D or 3D), enabling users to see how close they are to different ethnic groups.

## How It Works

The core of this project relies on PCA to separate ethnicities based on genetic similarities:

1. **VCF File Input**: The user uploads a VCF file containing their SNP data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The system extracts genotypic information from the VCF file, converting it into a matrix format where each row corresponds to an individual, and each column represents a specific SNP.
3. **PCA Analysis**: PCA is applied to reduce the high-dimensional genetic data into two or three principal components that capture most of the genetic variance.
4. **Visualization**: The user's data is visualized alongside known ethnic groups from the 1000 Genomes Project, making it easy to infer ethnicity by proximity in PCA space.

## Demo

You can try the live version of this app here: [**Link to the live app**](https://genetic-ahehcymg6cfzegwzpfhefa.streamlit.app/) (e.g., Streamlit Cloud or another hosting platform).

Hereâ€™s what you can do with the app:
- **Upload** your own VCF file to infer your ethnicity.
- **Explore** how your genetic data is placed relative to known populations (from the 1000 Genomes Project).
- **Learn** how PCA is used to separate different ethnic groups based on genetic data.

## Installation

If you want to run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/genetic.git
